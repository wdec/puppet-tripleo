features:
  - Enable innodb_file_per_table for MySQL/MariaDB databases
upgrade:
  - |
    Newly created MySQL database tables will be stored in their own datafiles,
    instead of in a single monolithic ibdata file.
  - |
    Existing MySQL database tables that are persisted within the monolithic
    ibdata file will remain so unless the database is migrated as well.
  - |
    Migration of all current database tables out of the monolithic ibdata
    file is possible by dumping and restoring the whole database to a new data
    directory, however when using Galera the entire cluster must be shut
    down and upgraded at once.
  - |
    Migration of individual tables to datafiles is possible using the
    MySQL command "ALTER TABLE <databasename>.<tablename> ENGINE=InnoDB;",
    however this will not shrink the ibdata file and also is not safe to run
    on a running Galera cluster for large tables.
