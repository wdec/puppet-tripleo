    Ignore failures if nf_conntrack_proto_sctp module failed to load.
    Since RHEL 7.4, nf_conntrack_proto_sctp module is compiled into the
    kernel instead of as a module as the sctp support.
    TripleO will still try to load the module to support RHEL 7.3, but
    in the future will remove the module management and rely on the kernel
    provided in newer versions of RHEL.
